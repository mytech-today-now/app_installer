enhancement:

 the app installation script 'app_installer\install.ps1' is itself a power shell application will appear when running  in its own window.  'install.ps1' will offer a menu of applications to install.  The user can select the applications to install.  The user can also select to install all applications.  The user can also select to install only the applications that are not already installed.  'install.ps1' will offer status on what software is already installed and what hasn't been installed yet.  The status will indicate what version of the software is running, if it is installed.

The individual app installation scripts (chrome.ps1, brave.ps1, notepad++.ps1, etc...) are individual to individual applications.
